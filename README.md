#Game Design

##Objective

Collect all stars and Gems in each level. 
## Gameplay Mechanics
The game is set up in overhead view, the play scen is a 2D plane. The stars or gems are distributed in the play scene, also some barrier and bombs are distributed in the scene.
The collector is a plate which can be launched by touch and slide in different directions.
Players would at first place some barrier himself to help change the route of the plate.


## Level Design
Each level is a single play scene. With a possible solution route in mind, some barriers were removed and left for user to place on the scenes.

Since we need to do a slide and lunch of the plate, the level should be in vertial mode. And the boundary of the scene is not solid.
